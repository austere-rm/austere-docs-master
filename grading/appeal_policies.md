# Grade Appeal Policies

Every student taking RCOS for credit has an opportunity to appeal their final grade. The specific policies and process for appealing a grade are outlined below.

After grades are posted on SIS, you have a grace period of 7 days to request a grade appeal. To request a grade appeal, fill out and submit [our appeal form](https://forms.gle/UgQ4DDivabaWfZxX7). A faculty advisor will take a look and evaluate your appeal.
